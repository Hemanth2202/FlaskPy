## UL Assignment

This demonstration shows how to combine a 2D CNN, RNN and a CTC loss to build a Speech Recognition System. CTC is an algorithm used to train deep neural networks in speech recognition, handwriting recognition and other sequence problems. CTC is used when we donâ€™t know how the input aligns with the output (how the characters in the transcript align to the audio). The model we used is DeepSpeech2
